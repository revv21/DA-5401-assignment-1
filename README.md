## Overview
This repository contains the solution for **DA5401 Assignment #1**.  
The goal of the assignment is to explore the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** and uncover insights into what drives a movie’s success using data visualization.

The work is presented in a single Jupyter Notebook:  
- `DA5401_A1_solution.ipynb`

## Objectives
- Formulate and test a **hypothesis** about movie success.  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, parse JSON-like columns).  
- Create advanced **visualizations** to support the analysis.  
- Tell a **data story** connecting the hypothesis, results, and conclusions.
